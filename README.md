## What i thought
When i type some command in the terminal, i saw something like magic happen. I think i love command line tool, i love software.

What i think is cool about front end development, is that when i first see the hello world HTML file that i built, opened it in the browser. And every time i make some change or dynamic features in the page with JavaScript.
